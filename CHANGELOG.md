# 4.0.1 
- Bump `qr` dependency (from `^2.0.0` to `^3.0.0`).
- **BREAKING**: Rename `QrImage` to `QrImageView`

# 4.0.0
- Migrate to null safety

# 3.2.0
- Fix issue where finder patterns don't render correctly with the painter
- Small fixes + optimizations

# 3.1.0
- Fix issue with `emptyColor` rendering.
- Fix a bug related to placeholder image loading.
- Bump to Flutter 1.7+. Flutter API changes have necessitated a bump. Sorry.

# 3.0.1
- Added an example.

# 3.0.0
- Use `QrVersions.auto` and let the library pick the appropriate version for you.
- Add an image that will be overlaid in the centre of the widget. You can specify the image size but not position.
- `QrImage.onError` has been removed. It was horribly broken so we decided to not deprecate it and just remove it totally.
- `QrImage.errorStateBuilder` introduced to allow you to display an in-line `Widget` when an error (such as data too long) occurs. By default the error state `Widget` will be constrained to the `QRImage` bounds (aka a Square) but you can use the `constrainErrorBounds` property to prevent that.
- A bunch of bug fixes you can look at in the source code.

# 2.1.0
- The `gapless` option is now `true` by default.
- Allow assigning `Key` values to `QrImage` widgets.
- Update `qr.dart` dependency.
- `qr.dart` is now exported so you don't need a second `import`.
